# Cassowary in Go

This is an implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm in Go. The initial implementation was based on the [Cassowary in Dart](https://github.com/flutter/cassowary/) written in Dart which itself is derived from [Kiwi toolkit](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) (written in C++). 

The implementation implements a subset of the functionality described in the [Cassowary paper](https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/solvers/cassowary-tochi.pdf)
